### Hi there!  

ðŸ‘‹ My name is Marzena and I'm a keen and motivated individual who aspires to a career in **software testing**!

After fifteen years of working in education, translations and administration, I decided to change my career path. Why testing? QA aligns with my passions and my personality. **Quality** has always been at the heart of my endeavors, so why not make it the focus of my professional life?

:monocle_face: I'm currently studying the basics of:
* manual testing - see: [Mobile App Manual Tests](https://github.com/m-sowa/Mobile-App-Manual-Tests), 
* SQL - see: [The Books Database](https://github.com/m-sowa/The-Books-Database), 
* HTML/CSS - see: [My Portfolio Website](https://github.com/m-sowa/My-Portfolio-Website), 
* API testing - see: [Simple API Testing Project](https://github.com/m-sowa/Simple-API-Testing-Project),
* Python,
* ISTQB Foundation Level.
