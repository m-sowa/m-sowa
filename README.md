### Hi there!  

ðŸ‘‹ My name is Marzena and I'm a keen and motivated individual who aspires to a career in **software testing**!

After fifteen years of working in education, translations and administration, I decided to change my career path. Why testing? QA aligns with my passions and my personality. **Quality** has always been at the heart of my endeavors, so why not make it the focus of my professional life?

:monocle_face: I've devoted the past months to study the basics of:
* manual testing, 
* SQL, 
* HTML/CSS, 
* API testing,
* Python,
* ISTQB Foundation Level.

:hammer_and_wrench: This GitHub profile is brand new so it's currently **under construction**. Some content will appear in the near future.
